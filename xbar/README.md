# tilt-xbar

An [xbar](https://xbarapp.com/) plugin to control Tilt from the macOS menubar.

## Install

1. Install and run xbar
2. Check out this repository
3. Install the plugin by symlinking the tilt-xbar script into the xbar plugins directory:
```
ln -s $PWD/xbar/tilt-xbar "~/Library/Application Support/xbar/plugins/tilt.2s.sh"
```

I might submit this as a pull request to xbar-plugins in the future, making it possible to install from within xbar.
