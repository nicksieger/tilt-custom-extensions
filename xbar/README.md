# tilt-xbar

An [xbar](https://xbarapp.com/) plugin to control Tilt from the macOS menubar.

## Install

1. Install and run [xbar](https://xbarapp.com/)
2. Install the plugin with the following command:
```
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nicksieger/tilt-custom-extensions/main/xbar/install.sh | bash 
```

I might submit this as a pull request to xbar-plugins in the future, making it possible to install from within xbar.
